1. A while loop is formatted very similarly to an if statement. The contents are repeated while the condition is true.
The for loop is formatted so that you can provide a variable, condition, and modifying action all inside the first line.

2. Four parts of a for loop are a variable, condition, modifying action, and the inside of the function which is the action 
you want to do. 

3. Nested loops allow you to loops different variables in the same loop.
